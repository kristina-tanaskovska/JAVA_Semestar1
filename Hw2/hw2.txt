EXPLANATION:
-How the program works
The for loop adds b + b looped 869 times but the value of b changes for every
loop and is the new sum of b+b. The result is 85*2^869 which has around 260 digits. 

-Why we got the result 0: There is overflow to the max memory of the integer data type
(Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
multiple times since the program displays 0. If it was done a few times the 
program would show a negative number. The same result showed with long.

To get all the digits of the result we need an imported library like 
java.math.BigInteger. that can handle working with big numbers.
